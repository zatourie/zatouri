부제: 공부할게 왜이리 많나요


Within the type system of a programming language, a typing rule or a type constructor is:
 * covariant if it preserves the ordering, ≤, of types, which orders types from more    specific to more generic;

 * contravariant if it reverses this ordering;
bivariant if both of these apply;

 * invariant or nonvariant if neither of these applies.
