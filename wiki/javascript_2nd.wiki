  ** The || operator can be used to fill in default values:
{{{
var middle = stooge["middle-name"] || "(none)";
}}}
  ** Attempting to retrieve values from undefined will throw a TypeError exception. This can be guarded against with the && operator:
{{{
flight.equipment.model //throw TypeError
flight.equipment && flight.equipment.model //undefined
}}}
